        <div class="subheading mb-5"> In-N-Out Level 2 üçî</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently a first-year at UCR. I am also working a part-time job at In-N-Out while being a full-time student. I am a first-generation college student, so balancing school and work is something new for me. I enjoy working hard to accomplish things. It is a great feeling to be rewarded for what you work for. I lived in Aberdeen-Inverness, one of the dormitories at UCR. It was great to experience a hint of adult-hood and finding your way through life. At work, it is essential to remain efficient in a fast-paced environment. Therefore, it is necessary to have patience too. I have learned a lot from working at In-N-Out since it is my first job.
I now realize how hard it is to work to earn money and especially saving it too. Working with different people can show you various aspects of the world. Having a fast-paced job is something you can learn a lot from. On my first day at the job, I was extremely nervous because I did not know what it was like nor what I would be doing. It was hard to gain confidence in an environment where everyone is an expert compared to being a new hire. After 3 weeks of learning how to work the register, prepare the preparation area, etc., I gained confidence in myself and believed that I could be a great worker. After 3 weeks, my manager assigned me to train 2 new hires on their first day. I did not expect it, but it felt good to know that I was a reliable person in someone else‚Äôs eyes. For me gaining confidence and losing some anxiety when working has been one of my accomplishments throughout these past months.
In contrast, college was a new journey for me as well, and I am proud to major in the sociology field. I have taken college-course throughout my high school journey, so I feel that that showed me a glimpse of what college was going to be like. During my first year of college, I took a sociology course from which I learned a lot from, especially with important world issues that we live in today. It widened my perspective about the world we live in today, and I believe that you grow as a person when you learn new things. Although it is difficult to manage school and work life, I feel that I can do it. Being a first-generation student has taught me that there is much more to life, and you can find opportunities anywhere you go and succeed. I believe that anyone can achieve ultimate success if they put their mind and hard work into their goals. I am ready for the next phase in my life, and I hope to pursue a career that I love when I graduate. It is essential to do what you love, which is an integral part of happiness. I enjoy being busy and working hard. In conclusion, I have had many accomplishments in my life, but my next one is to find ultimate happiness within myself!
